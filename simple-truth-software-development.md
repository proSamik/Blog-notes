I'm unlearning everything I know about software development.

Because most of it isn't true.

**Here's what I was taught:**

- Code with OOP principles
- Build scalable from Day 1  
- Handle all edge cases before shipping
- Follow complex design patterns
- Plan everything upfront

**All designed to keep us in the development loop.**

## The Simple Truth

**Function-based design principle also works.**

You don't need complex inheritance hierarchies. Simple functions that do one thing well.

**Pivot as customer base increases.**

Don't build for 1 million users when you have 10. Scale when you need to scale.

**Fix your feedback.**

Ship fast. Get real user feedback. Fix what actually breaks, not what might break.

## What Actually Matters

**1. Does it solve the problem?**
Perfect code that solves the wrong problem is worthless.

**2. Can users understand it?**
Complex features that confuse users are failures.

**3. Can you maintain it?**
Clever code that you can't debug at 2 AM is technical debt.

**4. Does it ship?**
Code that never reaches users creates zero value.

## My New Approach

**Start simple. Stay simple.**

- Use the simplest solution that works
- Add complexity only when forced by real problems
- Optimize for readability, not cleverness
- Ship early, iterate based on feedback

**Build multiple SaaS to test what the market demands.**

Instead of building one "perfect" product, I build multiple simple ones. Let the market tell me what works.

**Do the right things at the right time.**

- Day 1: Validate the idea
- Day 30: Build MVP
- Day 60: Get first customers
- Day 90: Optimize based on usage

## The Results

Since adopting this approach:

- Shipped 3 products in 6 months (vs 1 in 2 years before)
- Reduced development time by 70%
- Increased user satisfaction (simpler = better UX)
- Less stress, more creativity

## The Lesson

**Software development isn't about writing perfect code.**

It's about solving real problems for real people.

**The best code is the code that ships and works.**

Everything else is academic.

**Stop optimizing for imaginary problems.**

Start optimizing for real users.

**Distribution > Code.**

A simple solution that reaches 1000 users beats a perfect solution that reaches 10.

## For Developers

Question everything you've been taught.

Ask yourself:
- Does this complexity serve users?
- Am I solving real problems or imaginary ones?
- Can I ship this today?
- Will this matter in 6 months?

**The market doesn't care about your elegant architecture.**

It cares about whether your product solves their problem.

Keep it simple. Ship it fast. Iterate based on reality.

That's the simple truth.
