<strong><u>Day 5: Project Building :</u></strong>

![](ReportComposeCampEvent_images/ReportComposeCampEvent_image14.png)

<strong>Date :</strong> 2 October 2022

<strong>Time : </strong>10 am - 12pm

<strong>Mode : </strong>Offline \(IT Lab III\)

<strong>Topics covered : </strong>

Kotlin and Compose are two popular programming languages used for the development of Android applications. The Android Calculator application is an example of a simple application that can be built using Kotlin and Compose in this session to give the hands on expireance to the students..

The application consists of two primary components - a user interface and a back-end logic. The user interface is built with Compose, a declarative UI toolkit for creating modern Android applications. Compose allows developers to quickly and easily create complex UI layouts, animations, and transitions. The back-end logic is handled by Kotlin, a modern, statically typed programming language. Kotlin is designed to be easy to read and write, and it provides a wide range of features that make it well-suited for developing Android applications.

The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel \(MVVM\) pattern, which is a popular architecture for Android applications. The ViewModel is responsible for managing the application's data and interacting with the back-end logic, while the View layer is responsible for displaying the data to the user. The ViewModel is written in Kotlin, and the View layer is written in Compose.
