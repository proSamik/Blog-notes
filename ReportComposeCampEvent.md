Day 5: Project Building :

![](images/input_html_directory_image14.png)

Date : 2 October 2022

Time : 10 am - 12pm

Mode : Offline (IT Lab III)

Topics covered : 

Kotlin and Compose are two popular programming languages used for the development of Android applications. The Android Calculator application is an example of a simple application that can be built using Kotlin and Compose in this session to give the hands on expireance to the students..

The application consists of two primary components - a user interface and a back-end logic. The user interface is built with Compose, a declarative UI toolkit for creating modern Android applications. Compose allows developers to quickly and easily create complex UI layouts, animations, and transitions. The back-end logic is handled by Kotlin, a modern, statically typed programming language. Kotlin is designed to be easy to read and write, and it provides a wide range of features that make it well-suited for developing Android applications. 

The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, which is a popular architecture for Android applications. The ViewModel is responsible for managing the application's data and interacting with the back-end logic, while the View layer is responsible for displaying the data to the user. The ViewModel is written in Kotlin, and the View layer is written in Compose.

Conclusion:

At the conclusion of this android educational session, we have covered the basics of developing an android application, from designing the UI to adding features. We have also discussed the different tools and techniques used to develop an android application. We hope that students have gained a better understanding of android development and have the confidence to create their own application.After all the camp was the great success with the help of the faculty incharge , speakers and the students those who participated.
